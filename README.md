# Spatial-Volume-Control-using-Computer-Vision
This project implements a spatial volume control system using computer vision techniques. Leveraging Google's Mediapipe library, a custom-built Hand Tracking module, and the Pycaw library for audio control, the system tracks the positions of the first index finger and thumb to dynamically control the volume of a device.
